## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

_Nexus - noun: a connection or series of connections linking two or more things._

Looking around for audiobook metadata, we realized there's no solid (or open) single source of truth. Further, some solutions had community curated data, only to close their API. As such, this project has been created to enable development to include multiple sources of audiobook content in one response.

This project also makes integration into existing media servers very streamlined. Since all data can be returned with 1-2 API calls, there's little to no overhead processing on the client side. This enables rapid development of stable client plugins. Audnexus serves as a provider during the interim of waiting for a community driven audiobook database, at which time audnexus will be a seeder for such a database.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- There are 2 ways to deploy this project - for the purposes of this project, this guide will only cover Docker deployment:
  - [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/)
  - Directly, via `pnpm run` or `pm2`
    - Mongo 4 or greater
    - Node/NPM 16 or greater
    - Redis

### Installing locally

- Install Mongo, Node and Redis on your system
- `pnpm install` from project directory to get dependencies
- `pnpm run watch-debug` to start the server

Test an API call with

```
http://localhost:3000/books/${ASIN}
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Tests for this project use the Jest framework. Tests can be done locally in a dev environment:

- `pnpm test`

After the tests have run, you may also browse the test coverage. This is generated in `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` under the project directory.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

API usage documentation can be read here: https://audnex.us/

Pre-rendered HTML documentation is also included in docs/index.html.

HTML can be re-generated from the spec, using:

```
redoc-cli build docs/spec/audnexus.yaml -o docs/index.html
```

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Once you have Docker Swarm setup, grab the `docker-compose.yml` from this repo, and use it to start the stack. Using something like Portainer for a Swarm GUI will make this much easier.

The stack defaults to 15 replicas for the node-server container. Customize this as needed.

Environment variables to add:

- `NODE_MAX_REQUESTS`: Maximum amount of requests per 1 minute period from a single source (default 100)
- `NODE_MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection URL, such as `mongodb://mongo/audnexus`
- `NODE_REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL, such as `redis://redis:6379`
- `NODE_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: Frequency (in days) to run scheduled update tasks (default 30). Update task is also run at startup.
- `TRAEFIK_DOMAIN`: FQDN for the API server
- `TRAEFIK_EMAIL`: Email to register SSL cert with

Once the stack is up, test an API call with

```
https://${TRAEFIK_DOMAIN}/books/${ASIN}
```

### Set up DB indexes to keep item lookups fast and to support searches.

1. Connect to the DB either from inside the mongodb container terminal or a MongoDB Compass/MongoSH session.

2. Switch to the correct DB: 
    ```
    use audnexus
    ```

3. Create the recommended indexes:
    ```
    db.authors.createIndex( { asin: 1, region: 1 } )
    ```
    ```
    db.books.createIndex( { asin: 1, region: 1 } )
    ```
    ```
    db.chapters.createIndex( { asin: 1, region: 1 } )
    ```
    ```
    db.authors.createIndex( { name: "text" } )
    ```
